# Homework 1

In future homeworks, you will explain behaviour of predictive models. But in order to do so, you need to first train a few models.

Add your first homework as a pull request to this folder.

## Deadline 

2023-10-12 EOD

## Task

Train few predictive models for a selected ML problem. Compare their performance with a relevant performance measure(s).
Submit knitr/notebook script to this GitHub, to directory `Homeworks/HW1/FirstnameLastname`.

1. use any of the datasets listed in [Datasets](https://github.com/adrianstando/imbalanced-benchmarking-set/tree/main)
2. train 2-3 models with different structures (logistic regression, boosting, random forest or other) and evaluate their performance on the selected dataset (use train/test split or some other evaluation strategy)
3. carry out analyses in jupiter notebooks or Rmd (markdown) and convert it to HTML file
4. *Bonus*: you will get an additional point if you compare your models against TabPFN (https://github.com/automl/TabPFN)

## Format

The submitted homework should consist of two parts:

1. In the 1st part present key results and comments from point 3 (and 4). In this part **PLEASE DO NOT SHOW ANY R/PYTHON CODES, ONLY RESULTS (FIGURES, COMMENTS).**
2. The 2nd part should start with the word "Appendix" or "Załącznik" and should include the reproducible R/Python code with results used to implement points (1)-(4).
